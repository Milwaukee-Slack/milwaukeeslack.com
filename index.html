   <h2>Slack Info</h2>
   The Milwaukee slack started out as an IRC channel and has grown to nearly 3,000 members today. Its roots started with software development and technology but has grown to include much more over the years. With the growth has come a need for some rules to ensure civil and respectful discourse.

   <ol>
       <li>
           There is a <a href="https://github.com/Milwaukee-Slack/Code-Of-Conduct">Code Of Conduct - Read it.</a>
       </li>
       <li>
           Please introduce yourself in the #general channel when you join. If you are new to the Milwaukee area, there are many of us that are ready and willing to help you get accustomed to your new home.
       </li>
       <li>
           We expect that you will treat others with respect. Healthy discourse and debate is encouraged. We ask for patience and remind you that everyone has their own story and path that drives their point of view. It may be different than yours and that is ok.
       </li>
       <li>
           Jokes, including sarcasm, have their place in a conversation. We remind you that text is oftentimes misinterpreted and suggest the use of emojis or other context clues to help show intent. With that said, Trolling and bad faith arguments will not be tolerated.
       </li>
       <li>
           Channels have topics, please try to stay within those topics. A good conversation may drift and that is ok. If a channel is too off topic, a gentle nudge back to the channel purpose may be used from time to time.
       </li>
