   <h2>Slack Info</h2>
   The Milwaukee slack started out as an IRC channel and has grown to nearly 3,000 members today. Its roots started with software development and technology but has grown to include much more over the years. With the growth has come a need for some rules to ensure civil and respectful discourse.

           We expect that you will treat others with respect. Healthily discourse and debate is encouraged. We ask for patience and remind you that everyone has their own story and path that drives their point of view. It maybe different than yours and that is ok.

       <li>
           Jokes, including sarcasm, have there place in a conversation. We remind you that text is often times misinterpreted and suggest the use of emojis or other context clues to help show intent. With that said, Trolling and bad faith arguments will not be tolerated.
